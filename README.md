## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hsivritepe/job-hunter/main/public/job-hunter-screenshot.png)

I’m developing an application designed to streamline and simplify the process of managing job applications.

This tool enables users to meticulously track essential details, including the applied job positions, application timestamps, comprehensive company information, job posting links, and associated resume links.

It also facilitates history tracking, allowing users to monitor changes, record rejections, and note interview dates. With this app, staying organized and informed throughout the job application journey becomes effortless.

## Built With

-   React
-   JavaScript
-   Next.js
-   Node.js
-   MySQL
-   Prisma
-   TailWind

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

-   npm

```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Usage

How you use the app is simple:

-   Create the company that you are applying for a job if it is not already created.
-   Create a new job entry to add the job application.
-   Add changes to history for the application when needed like interview date, rejection date, follow up email date, etc.
